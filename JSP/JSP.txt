// thers is many drow back of using jsp
 -> when any brower send request to the servlet then the servlet page need to send the response as html. broser did not understand the java or other programing language 
      ,thats why we have to write the in our servlet in complex page we need to write hole the code in our servlet page.
-> JSP is the solution of this problem , we need to create html.jsp  , java code also wirte in the jsp code


-> disadvantages of JSP
   static content are genrated by java(dynamic content) from inside servlet. Designing in servlet is difficult 
   when we write our static content in our dynamic content , any change in our static content the we have to recompiler and redeploy  our code  then changes will show 
-> JSP is the extension of Servlet Technology but jsp provides more functionality than servlet	
example 	<% =new Date(). %>, jsp provides us to write code on the forms of tags
 JSP also provide some library JSTL(JSP Standered Tag Library) , custom tags 
// Comanly used tags in the JSP
->Declration tags in  JSP

<%!
variable;
method;
%>	

-> Scriptlet tags in  JSP

<%

out.println("as");

%>
-> Expresssion  tags in  JSP

<%=
out.println("as");
%>

-> Discriptive 	 tags in  JSP

<%@page import="java.util.ArrayList, java.util.Random" 	%>

->  include 
<%@include file=header.jsp	%	>


// JSTL (JSP Standard Library)
core-out,foreach,if
sql
formating

-> taglib directive // for to use this you need to Add jars in the in your Library
add jar og taglib directive
//  <%@taglib prefix="c" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" %>
  <c:set var="name" value="Abhishek_Sharma" ></c:set>
        <c:out value="${name}"></c:out>
	



// Custom Tags 
-> Why custom tag is required	
to use this there is 	TagSupport handler interface just you need to implement it and override its methord
// implicit object in jsp 
-> is that object that out.println(); is defined in the jsp , request.getParameter();,response.sendRedirect();,config(ServletConfig);,application(ServletContext);, session.isNew();


// Redirection in jsp/ How to redirect in jsp?
Create page1.jsp create link on the <a href="page2.jsp"> Go to page2</a>
at page 2 write 
<h1>page2<h2>
<%
	response.sendRedirected("page3.jsp");
response.sendRedirected("https://www.techsoftindia.co.in");
%>

// Concepts of filters in java servlet
 it is based on clinent request and response it  comes before the servet start for filtering the data , which filters the data that are in correct form or not ,it workers on both side before data 
map into database and after the database.
we can use server side validatioin in our servelt but we can using the filter for one time work on filter and put it multiple servlet.

-> in filter api there multiple interface 

   filter -> init(),doFilter(),destory();

          
   filterchain  request forward
   filterconfig  get data from web.xml and others form
