 -> when any brower send request to the servlet then the servlet page need to send the response as html. broser did not understand the java or other programing language 
      ,thats why we have to write the in our servlet in complex page we need to write hole the code in our servlet page.

   when we write our static content in our dynamic content , any change in our static content the we have to recompiler and redeploy  our code  then changes will show 
-> JSP is the extension of Servlet Technology but jsp provides more functionality than servlet	
example 	<% =new Date(). %>, jsp provides us to write code on the forms of tags
 JSP also provide some library JSTL(JSP Standered Tag Library) , custom tags 
// Comanly used tags in the JSP
