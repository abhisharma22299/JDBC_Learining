// thers is many drow back of using jsp
 -> when any brower send request to the servlet then the servlet page need to send the response as html. broser did not understand the java or other programing language 
      ,thats why we have to write the in our servlet in complex page we need to write hole the code in our servlet page.
-> JSP is the solution of this problem , we need to create html.jsp  , java code also wirte in the jsp code


-> disadvantages of JSP
   static content are genrated by java(dynamic content) from inside servlet. Designing in servlet is difficult 
   when we write our static content in our dynamic content , any change in our static content the we have to recompiler and redeploy  our code  then changes will show

-> Scriptlet tags in  JSP

<%

-> Expresssion  tags in  JSP

<%=
out.println("as");

-> Discriptive 	 tags in  JSP

<%@page import="java.util.ArrayList, java.util.Random" 	%>

->  include 
<%@include file=header.jsp	%	>


// JSTL (JSP Standard Library)
core-out,foreach,if
sql
formating

-> taglib directive // for to use this you need to Add jars in the in your Library
add jar og taglib directive
//  <%@taglib prefix="c" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" %>
  <c:set var="name" value="Abhishek_Sharma" ></c:set>
        <c:out value="${name}"></c:out>
	



// Custom Tags

// implicit object in jsp 
-> is that object that
